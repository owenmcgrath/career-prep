# Module 1. 
Linear and non-linear data structures, understanding time and space, design strategies in detail. 

Two important aspects: Algorithms, Data Structures

primitive Data structures: bool, int double etc
non-primitive: linear and non-linear. 

linear: static (arrays) and dynamic (lists, stacks, queues)
nonlinear: trees and graphs
