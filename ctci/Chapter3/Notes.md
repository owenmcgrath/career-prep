# Stacks & Queues
## Implementing a stack
- In some problems it might make more sense to stack data in a stack rather than array
- Stacks are last in, first out with the following operations
  - pop
  - push
  - peek
  - isEmpty
- No constant time access of I item, constant time adds and removes
- certain recursive algorithms like stacks
- can be used to replace recursive algorithms with iterative ones
## Implementing a queue
- First in First out. Items are removed in the same order they are added
- operations
  - add
  - remove
  - peek
  - isEmpty
- Queues are often used in breadth first search or cache's
