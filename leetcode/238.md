guaranteed to fit into a 32 bit integer.

A solution with O(n) space and O(n) time. 
have two vectors, one representing subsequent products before i, one representing subsequent products after i. 

i.e.
[1,2,3,4]
before = []
after = [4, 12, 24] -> result[i] = 24
iterate so that we get [4, 12] [1], return 12 * 1 = 12
iterate so that we get [4][1, 2], return 4*2 = 8
iterate so that we get [] [1, 2, 6] return 6 = 6.

This runs in O(n) space, but considering we have to generate an array anyway for the output, this is optimal. I don't think doing this in place makes sense anyway. 

vector<int> productOfArrayExceptSelf(const vector<int>& values)
{
    vector<int> front;
    vector<int> back;
    vector<int> toReturn;
    int lastBackValue = 1;
    for(int i = values.size() - 1; i > 0; i--)
    {
        back.push_back(lastBackValue * values[i]);
    }

    int lastFrontValue = 1;
    int backIt = back.size() - 1;
    for(int j = 0; j < values.size(); j++)
    {
        toReturn.push_back(lastFrontValue * back[backIt]);
        backIt--;
        front.push_back(lastFrontValue);
        lastFrontValue *= values[j];
    }
}
